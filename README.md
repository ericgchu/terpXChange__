## App Description
This app will allow college students to buy, sell, and exchange 
textbooks within college campuses to help allievate astronomically high 
textbook costs. This app will ultimately solve 2 problems; students looking 
for an affordable yet legitimate way to buy textbooks & students looking 
for a legitimate market to get rid of their textbooks while making some extra cash. 

## Minimal Goals
There will be a home feed section of the app to display all listed marketplace items.   
The app will allow users to post textbook pictures & details. 
There will also be tags like 'Buy', 'Sell', 'Exchange'. 
Categorizing textbooks by Dept. & courses. 

## Stretch Goals
We have identified the following stretch goals:
* Chat messaging feature 
* Different college campuses 
* Items other than textbook categories 

## Project Timeline
### Milestone 1 - 3/12/2021
* Create login/signup interface w/ Firebase backend 
* Home feed/ Upload/ Profile sections (but not 100% built)
* Develop & style UI/UX interface features to be functional
### Milestone 2 - 4/02/2021
* Implement textbook image upload feature
* Enable tags & scroll view in the home view feed 
* Built out profile so users can see other textbooks you are selling 
### Milestone 3 - 4/16/2021
* Implement Dept. & course specific categories 
* Change profile picture icon, Edit listing captions, implement 'SOLD' tag 
* Finalize Firebase infrastructure 
At this point, we will begin working on the stretch goals
### Final submission
